## Description

My motivation is to be able to create a README file that will help any developer in describing the project they are currently working on.
I built this project in order to expand my abilities as a developer and to save time for the user while working on their project. This will create a professional README file quick and simple. 
This application allows user to create a professional README.md file. This app uses Node.js and inquirer to create prompts for the user to answer some questions and then creates a README document, which will be generated, when the user responds to all prompts.

## Installation

The user will need to have node.js to run the program. If the user does not have node.js, the user will have to download it. Also, the necessary modules have to be downloaded. The modules will be fs(which is part of Node.js), and inquirer. Once the modules are downloaded, the user needs to answer all questions in the terminal. When all the questions have been answered, it will generate a README.md file. 


## Usage

When the user opens the terminal, the user will have to run node index.js. The application will prompt the user questions on the terminal to fill in the README file. Once all questions have been answered, a README.md file will be generated.
